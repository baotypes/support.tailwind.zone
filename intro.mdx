TAILWIND is a protocol for launching pre-sale tokens on Sei. 
You can participate in pre-sales (with or without team allocation) 
before the token doubles in price and migrate to DEXes (Astroport or DragonSwap).

<Tip>
Tokens can be up to 12 times cheaper before they move to DragonSwap or Astroport.

# What are pre-sale tokens?

Pre-sale tokens are tokens that are bought and sold by insiders at much cheaper prices
before they are available to others. Pre-sale participants get the best prices before 
the tokens get launched on DEXes.

# How does TAILWIND work?  


1. 🛍️ Pick a pre-sale token

2. 🛒 Buy the token

3. 💵 Sell at any time until funding goal is met

4. 🚀 When token reaches 9,000 SEI, your holdings are locked. Token doubles in price and migrates to DEXes

5. ⬆️ Then token vests linearly for its duration (20 minutes) and you have access to liquidity. Vesting protects you from bots snipers.
